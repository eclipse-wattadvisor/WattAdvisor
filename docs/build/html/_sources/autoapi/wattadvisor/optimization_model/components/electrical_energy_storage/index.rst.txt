.. py:class:: Component(name: str, interest_rate: None | float = None, parameters: None | dict = None)

   
   Parent base class for all optimization energy components.
   Contains empty methods which are overidden by child classes.

   :param name: Name of the component
   :type name: str
   :param interest_rate: Interest rate to determine annuity factor for investment calculation of the component, by default None
   :type interest_rate: None | float, optional
   :param parameters: Dictionary of techno-economic parameters of the component, by default None.
                      A dict of the following structure is expeceted.
                      At least one key at first level ("scalars" or "tabs") is required:

                      .. code-block:: json

                          {
                              "scalars": {
                                  "parameter_title": 0
                              },
                              "tabs": {
                                  "tab_title": {
                                      "key_1": 1,
                                      "key_2": 2
                                  }
                              }
                          }
   :type parameters: None | dict, optional

   :raises ValueError: If values of ``interest_rate`` and ``lifespan`` (from ``parameters``) are ``None``.


   .. py:method:: add_to_model(model: pyomo.core.Model, t: pyomo.core.RangeSet) -> pyomo.core.Model

      Calls the appropriate functions to add parameters, variables and constraints to the pyomo model given by `model`.

      :param model: Pyomo model to which the parameters, variables and constraints will be added.
      :type model: Model
      :param t: Time set over which time-variant parameters, variables and constraints will be added.
      :type t: RangeSet

      :returns: Pyomo model with the added parameters, variables and constraints
      :rtype: Model



.. py:class:: ElectricalEnergyStorage(name: str, interest_rate: float, parameters: dict, installed_capacity: float, installed_power: float | None = None, potential_capacity: float | None = None, potential_power: float | None = None, capex_power: float | None = None, capex_capacity: float | None = None, opex: float | None = None, lifespan: float | None = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`wattadvisor.optimization_model.components.base.Component`


   
   Component where electrical power can be stored and later taken out again, due to
   efficiency some of the energy is lost.

   :param name: Name of the component

   :param interest_rate: Interest rate to determine annuity factor for investment calculation of the component, by default None
   :type interest_rate: float
   :param parameters: Dictionary of techno-economic parameters of the component, by default None.
                      A dict of the following structure is expeceted.
