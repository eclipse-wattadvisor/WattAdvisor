   Bases: :py:obj:`wattadvisor.components.investment_component.InvestmentComponent`


   Component to turn an energy carrying medium like gas into electric and thermal power.
   2 different kinds of capacities have to be implemented for this, but since the
   production of electric power takes precedent the cost in the target function depends
   only on that

   :param capex: Capital expenditure cost of the component per electrical power [â‚¬/kW], by default 0
   :type capex: float, optional
   :param opex: Operational expenditure cost of the component per CAPEX per year [%/a], by default 0
   :type opex: float, optional
   :param eff_elt: electrical efficiency of the plant [kW electricity per kW gas]
   :type eff_elt: float
   :param eff_heat: thermal efficiency of the plant [kW heat per kW gas]
   :type eff_heat: float
   :param installed_power: Already installed electrical power of the component [kW] which acts as a lower bound, by default 0
   :type installed_power: float, optional
   :param potential_power: Maximum installable electrical power of the component [kW], by default None
   :type potential_power: float | None, optional
